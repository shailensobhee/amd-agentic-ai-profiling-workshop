## Overview

This is a hands-on, beginner-friendly workshop on **observability-driven optimization** of AI agents. You run a real [Hermes Agent](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/getting-started/quickstart), capture its telemetry (execution **traces** in MLflow and CPU/GPU **metrics** in Grafana `otel-lgtm`), read a purpose-built dashboard to spot the slowest step, optimize that one tool, and prove the speed-up with hardware metrics from an AMD Instinct&trade; MI300X GPU.

Text-to-speech (TTS) is only the example. The real subject is a **repeatable profiling loop** you can point at any agent task.

  <img src="assets/diagrams/01_pipeline.png" alt="Workflow: an input text file flows into the Hermes Agent, which calls a TTS tool that produces audio output; the workshop focus is profiling and optimization" width="90%">
</p>

## What you will learn

- Run a Hermes agent and capture its telemetry end to end
- Read a telemetry dashboard to identify a slow tool
- Swap in an optimized implementation of that tool
- Compare before and after, and see how GPU utilization changes

## The workflow you will follow

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/diagrams/03_loop.png" alt="The observability-driven loop: run the agent, fetch in the dashboard, inspect spans and GPU, optimize the slow tool, measure again, then repeat" width="88%">
</p>

Run the agent, **Fetch** the run in the dashboard, inspect the spans and GPU usage, optimize the slow tool, and measure again. Repeat until the bottleneck is gone.

## The optimization at a glance

The default TTS uses Edge TTS, which has some limitations. We therefore use a local TTS model. However, it processes one sentence at a time, leaving the MI300X mostly idle. The workshop introduces a **batched mode** that processes multiple sentences together in a single GPU pass, improving GPU utilization and performance.

## Repository contents

| Path | What it is |
| :--- | :--- |
| `tts.ipynb` | **The workshop notebook.** Start here. |
| `tts_executed.ipynb` | The same notebook with all cells already executed, so you can read the expected outputs without a GPU. |
| `utils/helper.sh` | One-shot launcher for the full backend (agent, telemetry, dashboard). |
| `utils/kokoro_server.py` | The local Kokoro TTS server (FastAPI + Uvicorn), including the batched inference path. |
| `utils/start_kokoro_server.sh` | Launches the Kokoro TTS server and waits until it answers `/health`. The notebook triggers it for the local Kokoro runs the optimization builds on. |
| `utils/hermes_profiler.py` | The Streamlit telemetry dashboard. |
| `utils/requirements.txt` | Python dependencies for the notebook and dashboard. |
| `utils/clear_cache.sh` | Clears the GPU kernel cache for cold-run benchmarks. |
| `custom_tools/kokoro_tts_tool.py` | The custom `kokoro_tts` tool added to Hermes. |
| `utils/Dockerfile`, `utils/docker-entrypoint.sh` | Build and run the all-in-one workshop container. See [utils/DOCKER.md](utils/DOCKER.md). |
| `assets/` | Diagrams, dashboard screenshots, and reference outputs. |
| `scripts/` | Generators that rebuild the diagrams and the notebook. |

## Prerequisites

| Requirement | Version tested |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Operating system** | Ubuntu 24.04 |
| **GPU** | AMD Instinct&trade; MI300X (192 GB VRAM) with ROCm support |
| **ROCm** | 7.14.1 (use `rocm-smi` instead of `amd-smi` on 6.4 and earlier) |
| **Python** | 3.12 with `venv` and `pip` |

Verify your GPUs are visible before you start:

```bash
amd-smi
```

> **Model note.** The agent is powered by **Muse-Glimmer-30B**, served with vLLM on the MI300X. The image builds **vLLM 0.29.0 from source** on a **ROCm 7.14.1** base (`rocm/dev-ubuntu-24.04:7.14.1-full`, Python 3.12). Muse-Glimmer-30B support is native in vLLM since v0.28.1 (upstream PR #51655), so no source patch is required for the model itself. The from-source build is what lets the workshop run on the latest ROCm 7.14.1 line; AMD's prebuilt `vllm/vllm-openai-rocm` release images still ship on ROCm 7.2.3.

---

## Quick start

The fastest path is the prebuilt Docker image, which bundles every service so
there is nothing to install. If you prefer to run on the host directly, skip to
[Manual setup](#manual-setup).

### Option A: Docker (recommended)

```bash
docker run -d --name amd-agentic-ai-profiling \
  --device=/dev/kfd --device=/dev/dri \
  --security-opt seccomp=unconfined --group-add video \
  --ipc=host --shm-size 16G \
  -p 8888:8888 -p 8501:8501 -p 5004:5004 \
  -e HERMES_PROXY_BASE="" \
  -v "$HOME/.cache/huggingface:/root/.cache/huggingface" \
  shailensobhee1/amd-agentic-ai-profiling:mi300x
```

> **Set `HERMES_PROXY_BASE`.** It controls the base of the notebook's "detailed view" links (the telemetry dashboard and MLflow). The container inherits the value you pass with `-e`, so set it to match where you open the notebook from:
> - `-e HERMES_PROXY_BASE=""` &rarr; direct `http://127.0.0.1:<port>/` links (use with the `-p` maps above; shown in the command)
> - `-e HERMES_PROXY_BASE="https://<your-proxy>"` &rarr; your own reverse proxy, as `https://<your-proxy>/<hostname>/proxy/<port>/`
> - omit it &rarr; the AMD hosted-notebook proxy `https://notebooks.amd.com/<hostname>/proxy/<port>/`

Watch it start with `docker logs -f amd-agentic-ai-profiling`. When it prints
`All services are ready`, open `http://<host>:8888/lab/tree/tts.ipynb`.

The first start downloads about 60 GB of model weights, so mount the Hugging
Face cache as shown to pay that cost only once. Full details, flags and
troubleshooting are in [utils/DOCKER.md](utils/DOCKER.md).

### Manual setup

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/shailensobhee/amd-agentic-ai-profiling-workshop.git
cd amd-agentic-ai-profiling-workshop
```

### 2. Create and activate a virtual environment

```bash
sudo apt install -y python3-venv
python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
```

### 3. Install the notebook dependencies

```bash
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
python -m pip install -r utils/requirements.txt
```

### 4. Start the backend (leave this terminal open)

In a **separate terminal**, set `HERMES_PROXY_BASE` and launch the full stack. This one script starts the agent model, the hermes-otel telemetry plugin, MLflow, Grafana `otel-lgtm`, and the dashboard, and prepares the GPU environment the local TTS server needs:

```bash
export HERMES_PROXY_BASE=""
bash utils/helper.sh
```

> **Set `HERMES_PROXY_BASE`.** It controls the base of the service links `helper.sh` prints and the notebook's "detailed view" links (the telemetry dashboard and MLflow):
> - `HERMES_PROXY_BASE=""` &rarr; direct `http://127.0.0.1:<port>/` links (shown above)
> - `HERMES_PROXY_BASE="https://<your-proxy>"` &rarr; your own reverse proxy, as `https://<your-proxy>/<hostname>/proxy/<port>/`
> - unset &rarr; the AMD hosted-notebook proxy `https://notebooks.amd.com/<hostname>/proxy/<port>/`

> Leave that terminal running for the whole workshop. It keeps the services alive; closing it shuts the backend down. When it finishes starting, it prints the service URLs you will use in the notebook.

### 5. Launch JupyterLab and open the notebook

```bash
jupyter lab --ip=0.0.0.0 --port=8888 --no-browser
```

Open **`tts.ipynb`** and work through it top to bottom. Everything from here on
happens inside the notebook. Pick the link base from the dropdown in the notebook's Step 2 cell (defaults to the value you set in step 4, if this is the same terminal).

<details>
<summary><b>Optional: force JupyterLab dark theme</b></summary>

<br>

The Hermes environment is designed with a dark theme. To match it:

```bash
mkdir -p ./env/share/jupyter/lab/settings
echo '{"@jupyterlab/apputils-extension:themes": {"theme": "JupyterLab Dark"}}' > ./env/share/jupyter/lab/settings/overrides.json
```

</details>

## The workshop backend

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/diagrams/02_architecture.png" alt="Agentic profiling architecture: the Hermes Agent runtime calls its TTS backends, the Edge TTS cloud baseline and the local Kokoro TTS server on the MI300X; hermes-otel sends execution traces to MLflow and CPU/GPU metrics to Grafana otel-lgtm; the Streamlit dashboard reads traces from MLflow and metrics from otel-lgtm to show one clear view" width="94%">
</p>

| Service | Port | Role |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Hermes backend (vLLM &middot; Muse-Glimmer-30B) | `8001` | The agent's model that plans and picks tools. |
| Hermes OTel | n/a | Sends execution traces to MLflow and CPU/GPU metrics to Grafana `otel-lgtm`. `helper.sh` sets a 100 ms sampling interval (`psutil` for CPU, `amdsmi` for GPU). |
| MLflow tracking server | `5004` | Stores the execution traces the dashboard visualizes. |
| Grafana `otel-lgtm` | `4318` / `9090` | Receives the CPU/GPU metrics over OTLP and stores them (Prometheus), which the dashboard queries. |
| Telemetry dashboard (Streamlit) | `8501` | A clean overview of each run: spans, CPU/GPU timeline, tool breakdown. |
| Kokoro TTS server | `8092` | The local, self-hosted TTS engine used in the optimization step. **The notebook starts this one** (see below). |

> **The local TTS server is started from the notebook.** `helper.sh` prepares
> everything its launch depends on (the shared `env/` venv, the ROCm PyTorch
> wheels, the MIOpen JIT headers) and leaves the server itself to the notebook,
> which runs `bash utils/start_kokoro_server.sh` once the cloud (Edge TTS)
> baseline has been profiled and the workshop moves to local Kokoro. The script
> is safe to re-run: a healthy server already on the port is left alone. The
> Docker path behaves the same way; `utils/docker-entrypoint.sh` leaves the
> server to that same notebook cell.

## Service reference

After `utils/helper.sh` is running, these are reachable on the host (replace `<server-ip>` with your machine's address):

| Interface | URL |
| :--- | :--- |
| Telemetry dashboard | `http://<server-ip>:8501` |
| MLflow UI (advanced) | `http://<server-ip>:5004` |
| JupyterLab | `http://<server-ip>:8888` |

---

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Fix |
| :--- | :--- |
| `which hermes` prints nothing in the notebook | `utils/helper.sh` has not finished starting, or the notebook was launched from a different environment. Wait for the backend, then relaunch Jupyter from the same shell. |
| Dashboard shows no runs | Click **Fetch**. Runs appear newest first; select the top one. |
| First Kokoro run is slow | Cold-run GPU kernel compilation. Subsequent runs reuse the cached kernels and are much faster. |
| `kokoro_tts` cannot connect on port `8092` | The TTS server is not running. Re-run the notebook cell that starts it (`bash utils/start_kokoro_server.sh`) and check `kokoro_server.log` in the repository root. |
| A port is already in use | `utils/helper.sh` frees its ports on start, but a stale process may linger. Stop it, then rerun. |
| vLLM cannot reserve enough VRAM | Another process is holding GPU memory. vLLM takes an `0.80` share by default; lower it with `GPU_MEMORY_UTILIZATION=0.70 bash utils/helper.sh`. |

## Regenerating the assets

The notebook and its diagrams are generated from scripts so they stay reproducible and reviewable:

```bash
python scripts/build_diagrams.py       # rebuild the AMD-branded concept diagrams
python scripts/build_tts_notebook.py   # regenerate tts.ipynb from the generator
```

The generator reuses the workshop's backend-driving code cells verbatim, so editing the prose can never change what the notebook actually runs.

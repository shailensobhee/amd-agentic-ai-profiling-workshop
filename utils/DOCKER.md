# Running the workshop in Docker

This image packages the entire workshop so attendees need one command instead of
a manual backend setup. It targets **AMD Instinct MI300X** with ROCm.

Image: `shailensobhee1/amd-agentic-ai-profiling:mi300x`

Software stack: **ROCm 7.14.1** (base `rocm/dev-ubuntu-24.04:7.14.1-full`, Python
3.12) with **vLLM 0.29.0 built from source** against the ROCm 7.14 PyTorch
wheels. Building vLLM from source is deliberate: the newest ROCm line (7.14.1)
is not yet carried by AMD's prebuilt `vllm/vllm-openai-rocm` release images,
which still ship on ROCm 7.2.3. Muse-Glimmer-30B needs no source patch (native
in vLLM since v0.28.1). Expect the vLLM compile to add roughly 30-60 min to a
cold image build; it is cached across rebuilds.

## What is inside

Everything runs as a local process inside the single container, so there is no
nested Docker and no host setup beyond the GPU devices.

| Component | Port | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| JupyterLab | `8888` | The workshop front door. Open `tts.ipynb`. |
| Telemetry dashboard (Streamlit) | `8501` | Spans, CPU/GPU timeline, tool breakdown. |
| MLflow tracking server | `5004` | The agent's execution traces. |
| Grafana `otel-lgtm` | `9090` / `3000` | CPU/GPU metrics (Prometheus on 9090, queried by the dashboard; Grafana UI on 3000). |
| vLLM (Muse-Glimmer-30B) | `8001` | The agent's model, OpenAI-compatible API. |
| Kokoro TTS server | `8092` | Local TTS on the MI300X. |

Also baked in: the Hermes Agent (preconfigured to use the local vLLM), the
`hermes-otel` plugin, the custom `kokoro_tts` tool, the notebooks, and all
workshop assets.

> **How this differs from `utils/helper.sh`.** On a bare host, `helper.sh`
> launches vLLM and Grafana `otel-lgtm` as *sibling Docker containers*. That
> cannot work unchanged inside an image without mounting the host Docker socket,
> so the container uses `utils/docker-entrypoint.sh` instead, which starts the
> same services (including `otel-lgtm`) as local processes and reaches the GPU
> directly. Both paths produce the same workshop.

## Prerequisites

- An AMD Instinct MI300X (or another ROCm-supported AMD Instinct GPU)
- A working ROCm driver on the host, so `/dev/kfd` and `/dev/dri` exist
- Docker
- About 60 GB of free disk for the model weights, plus room for the image

---

## Quick start

Everything runs inside one self-contained image, no separate metrics container
is needed, since Grafana `otel-lgtm` runs inside it.

```bash
docker run -d --name amd-agentic-ai-profiling \
  --device=/dev/kfd --device=/dev/dri \
  --security-opt seccomp=unconfined --group-add video \
  --ipc=host --shm-size 16G \
  -p 8888:8888 -p 8501:8501 -p 5004:5004 \
  -v "$HOME/.cache/huggingface:/root/.cache/huggingface" \
  shailensobhee1/amd-agentic-ai-profiling:mi300x
```

To use direct `localhost` links in the notebook instead of the AMD proxy, add
`-e HERMES_PROXY_BASE=""`. To reach the Grafana metrics UI, also map `-p 3000:3000`.

Then watch it come up:

```bash
docker logs -f amd-agentic-ai-profiling
```

When the log prints `All services are ready`, open
`http://<host>:8888/lab/tree/tts.ipynb`.

> **First start downloads about 60 GB of model weights.** Mounting the Hugging
> Face cache as shown means the download is paid once per host, not once per
> container. Later starts come up in minutes.

### Why each flag is needed

| Flag | Why |
| :--- | :--- |
| `--device=/dev/kfd --device=/dev/dri` | GPU access. Without these the entrypoint stops immediately with a clear error. |
| `--security-opt seccomp=unconfined` | Required by ROCm. |
| `--group-add video` | Grants access to the render nodes. |
| `--ipc=host --shm-size 16G` | Shared memory for PyTorch and vLLM workers. |
| `-v ...huggingface...` | Avoids re-downloading the model on every run. |

## Useful variations

**Protect JupyterLab with a token** (it is open by default for workshop convenience):

```bash
-e JUPYTER_TOKEN=choose-a-token
```

**Pick a different GPU:**

```bash
-e HERMES_GPU=3
```

**Share a busy GPU.** vLLM sizes its allocation against *free* VRAM, so it fails
to start if another process already holds a large share. The container defaults
to `0.80` instead of vLLM's `0.92` for that reason, and prints how much VRAM is
already in use before starting. Lower it further if needed:

```bash
-e GPU_MEMORY_UTILIZATION=0.70
```

**Open a shell instead of starting the services:**

```bash
docker run --rm -it \
  --device=/dev/kfd --device=/dev/dri \
  --security-opt seccomp=unconfined --group-add video \
  shailensobhee1/amd-agentic-ai-profiling:mi300x bash
```

**Persist notebook edits and outputs to the host:**

```bash
-v "$PWD/work:/workshop/outputs"
```

---

## Building it yourself

From the repository root:

```bash
docker build -f utils/Dockerfile -t amd-agentic-ai-profiling:mi300x .
```

The build runs `utils/img-check.sh`, which asserts the telemetry wiring (the
`.env` keys, the OTLP experiment header, and that the dashboard's assets and
theme resolve), so a broken image fails at build time rather than during the
workshop.

---

## Verified on hardware

This image was built and tested on a real AMD Instinct MI300X, not just
smoke-checked. The following were confirmed end to end inside the container:

| Check | Result |
| :--- | :--- |
| All five services reach a healthy endpoint | MLflow 5s, Kokoro 45s, dashboard 5s, JupyterLab 5s, vLLM about 4 min from a warm cache |
| vLLM serves the model | `max_model_len = 131072`, above the 64K minimum Hermes requires |
| Real GPU inference | Chat completion returned the expected text with a populated `reasoning` field, confirming the `muse_glimmer` parsers |
| Kokoro TTS on the GPU | `POST /tts/wav` returned 200 and produced 94 s of 24 kHz audio |
| Agent tool use | Hermes called `kokoro_tts` with the `text_file` parameter and wrote real WAV output |
| Profiling telemetry | MLflow recorded runs carrying vLLM cache-hit metrics |

---

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Cause and fix |
| :--- | :--- |
| `/dev/kfd is missing` on start | The GPU flags were omitted. Use the full `docker run` above. |
| Stuck at `Waiting for vLLM` | Normal on first start while weights download. Follow progress with `docker exec amd-agentic-ai-profiling tail -f /workshop/logs/vllm.log`. |
| A service exited and the container stopped | The entrypoint prints the tail of every log on failure. Inspect with `docker logs amd-agentic-ai-profiling`. |
| Dashboard is empty | Run a notebook cell first, then click **Fetch** in the dashboard and select the newest run. |
| Port already in use | Change the host side of the mapping, for example `-p 9999:8888`. |
| `vLLM could not reserve enough VRAM` | Another process is holding GPU memory. The entrypoint reports how much at startup. Retry with a lower `-e GPU_MEMORY_UTILIZATION=0.70`. |
| Agent loops without producing audio | The `kokoro_tts` tool failed to register. The image asserts this at build time, so this should not happen. Check with `docker exec <name> ls /usr/local/lib/hermes-agent/tools/kokoro_tts_tool.py`. |

Logs for every service live in `/workshop/logs/` inside the container.
